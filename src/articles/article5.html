            <h3>Matchup of the Week- Chips reign continues, while havoc dissapoints once again. </h3>

                    <p>
                        Once upon a time, Chip was the laughingstock of the Mafia Fantasy League—a perennial underachiever who could barely string together back-to-back wins.
                        But times have changed, and Chip is riding high, much to the chagrin of one person in particular: Havoc.

                    <P>
                        As Chip racks up victory after victory, Havoc seems stuck in an endless spiral of mediocrity. Actually, let’s be honest—mediocrity would be an improvement for Havoc. 
                        The man has taken losing to an art form. Once known for talking himself up, convincing anyone who would listen that he was destined for greatness, the reality couldn't be further from the truth.

            <h3>Commissioner in Crisis: A Downward Spiral?</h3>
                <section>
                    <p>
                        For the first time in Mafia Fantasy League history, the Commissioner finds himself in uncharted waters—an 0-2 start. 
                        After years of managing a team that was always in the playoff conversation, the once-mighty Commissioner now looks like he's losing his grip on both the league and his squad. 
                        This week's blowout loss to YB’s team wasn’t just a defeat—it was a thrashing.
                        And the whispers are growing louder: is the Commissioner’s reign over?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        YB didn't just win, he dominated from start to finish. 
                        It was as if YB was playing chess while the Commissioner was fumbling with checkers. 
                        The defeat was a painful one to watch, especially for a team that has historically had the Commissioner’s guiding hand to steer it to success. 
                        But now, it seems like that hand has gone limp. YB’s team ran circles around the Commissioner’s struggling lineup, exposing every weakness and capitalizing on each mistake.
